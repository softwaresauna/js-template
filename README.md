# Javascript Template

This is a template project, meaning it is created to be copied or forked to serve as a base for other software.

It comes equipped with:

- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- a sensible `.gitignore`
- a couple of dummy source files to demonstrate it works and is testable  

## Usage

Take the files and use them to start your own Javascript project.

### Using Yarn

- build: `yarn`
- test: `yarn test`
- start: `yarn start`
